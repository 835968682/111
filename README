This repository contains implementations of spatially aware machine learning models for analyzing the relationship between urban development and PM2.5 concentrations across Chinese cities. The code builds upon existing open-source implementations with modifications for our specific research needs.

## Model Implementations

### 1. Geographically Weighted XGBoost (G-XGBoost)

#### Key Modifications Made:
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Enhanced parameter tuning with extended search spaces and additional parameters
- **Model Persistence**: Added comprehensive model saving functionality for global and local models
- **SHAP Analysis Support**: Implemented model export compatible with SHAP analysis pipelines

### 2. Geographically Weighted Random Forest (GWRF)
